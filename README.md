Creating my own library for future projects

1. Git clone repository to your computer
2. type "make" to create static library file
3. type "make run" to run compile and execute main.c file
3a. you can modify the main file

1. The idea of this project is to create our own library of functions so we do not have to rewite them in the future projects.
At 42 we are not allowed to use printf and function from other libraries. We have to always prototype them.
